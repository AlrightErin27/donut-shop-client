The user can also create their own donut.

CRUD- Create a donut, Create a review. Read (display) reviews & donuts. Update your donut. Delete any donut.

## User Story

User sees donut shop page with the donut images and description displayed. This page also shows a small nav bar that lets you go to the bakery where you create your own donut or your donuts where you can see the donuts you personally have created.
If the user stays in the main page with the donut options available, the user can see buttons next to each donut.
The three buttons will allow the user to see the donut's reviews, review the donut, or delete the donut.
If the user is in the bakery page, they can create a donut. Once done the submit button returns you to the main page
where you will see that new donut among the other donuts. The create donut page also has a button that lets you change
a donut you have made. You can search by type of donut.
